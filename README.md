## ðŸ›  Problem Statement

Panic attacks are sudden, intense episodes of fear that significantly impact the well-being of individuals.  
Analyzing patterns related to panic attacks â€” their symptoms, triggers, demographics, and severity â€” can help healthcare providers better design interventions and treatment plans.

This dashboard aims to uncover key insights into panic attack occurrences, associated symptoms, and patient behavior patterns using real-world healthcare data sourced from a Snowflake database.

---

## ðŸ›¤ Steps Followed

- Data ingestion from **Snowflake Cloud Data Warehouse** into Power BI Desktop.
- Data transformation and cleansing using **Power Query Editor**:
  - Handled missing values, corrected data types.
- Development of critical **DAX Measures** for:
  - Symptom-wise patient distribution
  - Average Panic Scores
  - Attack Frequency analysis across demographics
- Visualization design split into 3 major dashboards focusing on symptoms, miscellaneous lifestyle factors, and demographic influences.
- Slicers implemented for gender, trigger reasons, medical history, and panic score levels.
- Published to **Power BI Service** for online sharing and collaboration.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights Derived

- **Common Symptoms:**  
  Dizziness, trembling, shortness of breath, sweating, and chest pain were commonly reported symptoms among patients.

- **Lifestyle Factors:**  
  - Number of drinks consumed per week and lesser sleep hours showed some correlation with panic attack intensity and frequency.
  - Shorter sleep durations (4â€“6 hours) were common among high-frequency patients.

- **Panic Attack Duration:**  
  Most panic attacks lasted between 20â€“30 minutes.

- **Age Group Analysis:**  
  - Adolescents and Adults showed varied average sleep hours, panic scores, and attack frequencies.
  - Social Anxiety and Phobia were among the most common trigger reasons across age groups.

- **Gender Distribution:**  
  Slight variations were observed among male, female, and non-binary patients across symptom reporting.

## ðŸ§  Key DAX Measures Used

1. **Number of Patients Having Dizziness:**
```DAX
Dizziness_Count = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('Panic_Attack_Data'),
    'Panic_Attack_Data'[Dizziness] = TRUE()
)
```

2. **Number of Patients by Sleep Hours:**
```DAX
Patients_by_Sleep_Hours = 
SUMMARIZE(
    'Panic_Attack_Data',
    'Panic_Attack_Data'[SleepHours],
    "Patient_Count", COUNT('Panic_Attack_Data'[PatientID])
)
```

3. **Average Panic Score by Age Group:**
```DAX
Avg_Panic_Score = 
AVERAGEX(
    FILTER('Panic_Attack_Data', NOT(ISBLANK('Panic_Attack_Data'[PanicScore]))),
    'Panic_Attack_Data'[PanicScore]
)
```

4. **Average Panic Attack Frequency by Trigger Reason:**
```DAX
Avg_Panic_Attack_Frequency = 
AVERAGEX(
    FILTER('Panic_Attack_Data', NOT(ISBLANK('Panic_Attack_Data'[AttackFrequency]))),
    'Panic_Attack_Data'[AttackFrequency]
)
```
